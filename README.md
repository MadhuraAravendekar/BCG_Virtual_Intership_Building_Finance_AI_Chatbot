**My Role in this project / Persona**

My role as a junior data scientist in the GenAI Consulting team is pivotal in developing an AI-powered chatbot that can analyze and provide insights on corporate financial performance from 10-K and 10-Q financial documents. This chatbot is intended to revolutionize the way GFC and its clients interact with financial data, making complex information easily accessible and understandable through conversational AI.

**My Goal / What I want to achive**

My primary objective is to extract and analyze key financial data from the client's 10-K and 10-Q documents. 
This involves understanding financial statements, identifying significant trends, and preparing data for AI-driven applications.
Following the data analysis, I will develop an AI-powered financial chatbot. 
This chatbot will be capable of analyzing financial data and providing insights that effectively communicate complex financial information in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
Throughout the project, my focus will not only be on the technical execution but also on how these AI-driven insights can be leveraged in a consulting context to provide strategic recommendations and solutions to clients.
